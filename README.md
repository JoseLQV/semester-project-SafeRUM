# SafeRUM - Campus Safety Notification System

# Project Overview

SafeRUM is a mobile app that aims to improve emergency communication and campus safety at our university. Currently, safety alerts are often sent via email, which can lead to delays and unreliable notification. SafeRUM addresses this issue by providing a centralized platform for timely, location-specific safety information and resources.

# Key Features

    Real-time Emergency Alerts: SafeRUM delivers push notifications, SMS, and in-app alerts to users based on their location, ensuring they receive urgent safety information during emergencies.

    Safety Resources: The app provides users with access to important safety details, such as potential hazards, emergency procedures, and evacuation routes.

    Reporting Capabilities: SafeRUM allows users to quickly report safety concerns, suspicious activities, or emergency incidents directly to campus security.

    Security Integration: The app facilitates direct communication with campus security, enabling users to call for assistance or send alerts that require an immediate response.

# Summary

By implementing the SafeRUM app, we aim to improve safety communication, enhance reporting and response to threats, better prepare the campus community for emergencies, and streamline coordination between users and campus security.
